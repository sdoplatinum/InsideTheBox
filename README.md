# InsideTheBox

## MVP
#### Summary
Inside the Box is a simple sidescroller game with a stick figure that has to get to a door to progress to the next level. The catch of the game is the need to use unconventional ways to get to the goal: stepping out of the frame of the game, turning back a clock by hand, intentionally jumping into a pit, etc. All of this is directed by short quotes form a bodiless narrator appearing on the screen to guide, and mock, the hero.

#### MVPs

+ implement gravity so the stick figure is stuck to the bottom of the screen and falls
+ implement collision so the hero can stand on the ground and on a platform
+ make the screen scroll
+ make a level change when the hero reaches the door
+ build levels
